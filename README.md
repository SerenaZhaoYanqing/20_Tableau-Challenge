In this analysis, we aim to uncover the citi bike performance in 2021 (Panamic period), identifying business opportunity. There are three dashboards with one overview map containing the population infomation in this analysis.

## General introduction of Citibike :bike:

* Quarterly Performance in 2021: Total trips has been breakdown by quarters in 2021, which has suggested quarter 3 has been the busiest quarter of the year. 
* Rideship Growth Over Month in 2021: The percentage difference over month has suggested that the biggest increase in total trips with 170.6% happended in May, with strong growth on the following months until November. 
* Peak Hour:  We have spotted that both winter and summer has a peak hour of 6pm, which are very likely due to off work hour peak.

**Consusion**: As per information that we have gathered from first dashboard, the peak hour could suggest that the increasing demand at 6pm is due to communting, we could allocate out more available bikes near office area and public transportation near communiting hours. Demand is higher in Q3, however the spike in demand happened on May when weather become warmer, which has indicated the weather would impact demand. 


## The most popular start and end stations overview :station:

* We have picked the top 30 start stations and end stations for total trips completed, we have noticed that there are a lot overlapped stations. 
* The most popular stations like Grove St Path, Columbus Dr at Exchange PI, New port path, Marin light rail are all close to train station, which has also proved that our conclusion on "the increasing demand on peak hours was due to communting" is correct. 


## Deep Dive (Gender, Age, Subsciption) :girl::boy::woman::man::older_woman::older_man:

* Based on the analysis, excluding unknown data, we have more male customers than male customer
* As per age group, people aged less than 20 years and people between 50-60 years old averagely spend the most time on each trip, (51 minutes and 45 minutes repectively), however, those two ago group has the less percentage customer that are subscripting to our services ( 27.91% and 36.90% repectively)
* With average trip duration, despite the fact that we have more male customers, most age group, female customer spend more time on each trip. 

**Conculsion** As per above results, the main area to develop for the company will be: 
1. Attracting more female customer  ( research on if the bike type is more sutiable for male rather than female, or generally riding bicycle is more popular among male customers etc) 
2. Engage young customer (<20 years) and old customers (50-60 years) to subscribe our services. ( demostrating to customer that as per the long ride that they normally do, it would save customers more money if they subscribe) 


## Overview Map 
* Finally, we have the distribution of all bike stations layered with population of each postcode.
